            <h1>This Is Earth</h1>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large
                volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface
                water.Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by
                tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation.
